        <h1>Chapter 5: Getting Your First Customers</h1>
    
        <p><a href=""><< Back to Chapter 4: From Idea to Building a Minimum Viable Product</a></p>

        <p>Getting your first customers van be really challenging. I've spoken to a lot of entrepeneurs
        who thought of and built a first version of a SaaS product that seemed like a great solution
        for a certain niche, but they just couldn't get that initial traction with customers.
        </p>

        <p>From my research I have found a few common strategies that have worked. Most fall into the
        category of things that don't scale. Some require that you do many months of preparatory work
        before you built the app.
        </p>

        <p>In Chapter 2 I point out that knowing how will you find your first 25 customers is part of finding
        a good business idea. If you truly have no idea, you probably shouldn't build the product.
        However you may also find it makes sense to work backwards from a group of customers to a business idea.
        </p>

        <p>For example you might find that roofing companies are extremely easy to find: they advertise
        their contact info in business directories and you could easily meet 10 roofers per day just by
        hanging out in the right section of a hardware store. Now you know that if you had a SaaS product
        for them, it would be very easy to find the first 25 customers and beyond.
